        //The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object,
        //named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers,
        //and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

        //A one-to-many dependency between objects should be defined without making the objects tightly coupled.
        //It should be ensured that when one object changes state, an open-ended number 
        // of dependent objects are updated automatically.
        //It should be possible that one object can notify an open-ended number of other objects.

        
        //7. Observer Define a one-to-many dependency between objects
        //so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
