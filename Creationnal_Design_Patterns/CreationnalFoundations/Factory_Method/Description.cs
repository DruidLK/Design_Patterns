        // we have 3 styles of pizza New York , texas, Chicago
        // each pizza can have a Type either cheese, pepperoni, vegetarian

        // so we need a factory to determine which type of pizza we need for each one
        // then factory method , it is like a client enters a store and orders a 
        // new york pizza and picks a type
        //the draw back is that the store only contains 1 style of pizza and cannot order
        // other styles

        // the problem with this factory is that u can only create
        // specific style store and cannot create other styles.
