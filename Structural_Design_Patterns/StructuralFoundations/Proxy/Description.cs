        //proxy is heavily used in microservices since it allows to abstract away further functions
        //let us assume we want to use the strategy pattern and we have multiple concrete classes
        //in order to keep our class organized we re able to add another class
        //domain service martin fowler names it as heavy artillery from the artillery,
        //instantiate the proxy pattern
        //same example of abstract factory however gonna use reflection to change stuff up.
