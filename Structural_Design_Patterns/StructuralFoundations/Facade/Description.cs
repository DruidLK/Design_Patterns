        //    a simple interface is required to access a complex system,
        //    a system is very complex or difficult to understand,
        //    an entry point is needed to each level of layered software, or
        //    the abstractions and implementations of a subsystem are tightly coupled.

        //21. Facade Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a system.
        //Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
